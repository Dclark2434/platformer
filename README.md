# Platformer
This is a basic platformer game prototype made using pygame. As a heads up, this is my first attempt at both pygame and Object-Oriented Programming. It's in its very early stages and far from being feature-complete or fully playable. This is the initial commit and it's recommended not to run this code as it's still very raw and may not offer much in terms of gameplay or features. However, you can look at the code to get an idea of the project's direction.
